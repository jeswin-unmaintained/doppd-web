A rethink of how to build Web Services and Apps.
--------

Deploy your first Service in 10 seconds.
Copy and paste this into your browser.
```
https://e443.nodejam.com/feetToMeters = (feet) => `${feet} feet is ${0.3048 * feet} meters.`
```

Now call it, by putting this in your browser bar
```
https://e443.nodejam.com/feetToMeters(100)
```

How about saving data?

Paste this to create a table
```
https://e443.nodejam.com/todos=[]
```

Add an item
```
https://e443.nodejam.com/todos.push({ description: "Get milk", importance: "high" })
```

Query it
```
https://e443.nodejam.com/todos.filter(t => t.important === "high")
```
